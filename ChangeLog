v0.7.1: 2004-11-03
  - fixed compilation problems on some platforms
  - ported 0.7.0 changes to cutsel.c

v0.7.0: 2004-09-11
  - fixed a bug when the first copy comes from the cutbuffer (jluu)
  - the -selection parameter now works
  - changed default selection to CLIPBOARD instead of PRIMARY (jluu)
    It means you now have to *COPY* and *PASTE* texts to have them handled
    by autocutsel. Just selecting text will only work in a few applications.
    If you want the old behavior, run "autocusel -selection PRIMARY"

v0.6.2: 2002-06-03
  - added a cutsel tools to change/retreive the cutbuffer
    or the selection
  - fixed minor bugs
		
v0.6.1: 2002-06-02
  - uses the length of values instead of '\0' at the end

v0.6: 2002-05-27
  - fixed a memory leak
		
v0.5: 2002-05-26
  - fixed a bug the prevented selection to be owned when
    the cutbuffer was modified
  - added dmalloc support (to find memory leaks)

v0.4: 2002-05-19
  - perform a last check before owning the selection
    to handle properly applications updating both cutbuffer
    and selection
  - autoconf & automake scripts
  - improved debug messages
  - memory leak fixed?
  - minor bugfixes
	
v0.3:
  - applied a patch from Mark Warburton to ignore the cutbuffer
    value if it's empty
  - added -verbose (displays what -debug displayed before)
  - changed -debug to display more debugging informations
  - modified the synchronization process. it should fix some
    update problems.

v0.2: 2001-07-15
