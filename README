autocutsel v0.1

Autocutsel is a tool to merge the two cut & paste buffers mainly used by X
applications. It is basically the same as xcutsel(1) but it's automatic.
It scans each buffer every 500ms and synchonizes them.
It currently only scans the PRIMARY selection and the cut buffer 0.

I made this tool to have a working cut & paste between Windows and my VNC
X desktop. I used xcutsel for some weeks and was bored clicking each time
I copied something.
It is my first X application and is full of borrowed code.

It is released under the GPL. See the COPYING file.

Any comment is welcome.
