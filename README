Copyright (c) 2001 - Michael Witrant

autocutsel synchronizes the two copy/paste buffers mainly
used by X applications.
It unifies "clipboards" between VNC servers and Windows

To install it, you might have to change some paths in the Makefile.

It is released under the GPL. See the COPYING file.


Any feedback is welcome.
