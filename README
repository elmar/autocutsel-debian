autocutsel synchronizes the two copy/paste buffers mainly
used by X applications.
It unifies "clipboards" between VNC servers and Windows

To build it:
 ./configure
 make

To install it (as root):
 make install

To run it:
 autocutsel
A small small square should appear in the bottom right of the screen.

Any feedback is welcome.
