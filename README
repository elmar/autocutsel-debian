autocutsel v0.2

Copyright (c) 2001 - Michael Witrant

Autocutsel is a tool to merge the two cut & paste buffers mainly used by X
applications. It is like an automated xcutsel(1).
It scans each buffer regularly and synchonizes them.

It gives a working cut & paste between Windows and a VNC X desktop even
when the Selection buffer is used (ie: GTK).


To install, you might have to change library paths in the Makefile

It is released under the GPL. See the COPYING file.


Any feedback is welcome.
